# Guess the Number Game

“Guess the Number” is a fun and interactive mobile game app built using React Native. The game challenges players to enter a number and then watch as the computer tries to guess what it is.The project was developed as part of my journey to learn React Native.

I closely followed the second section of Maximilian Schwarzmüller's comprehensive course [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide) on Udemy to build this app.

The goal of this section was to learn more about creating custom components, using JavaScript in React Native, handling user events, and working with different screens.
